Primary testing files:
run_mvsim_tests.m
run_svsim_tests.m
single_vehicle_scenario.m
test_single_vehicle.m

Outdated files preserved to show process:
build_deadlock.m

Results:
svsim_results.csv - Single-vehicle results
mvsim_results.csv - Multi-vehicle results

To run:
Open MATLAB and set the working directory to this folder.
Run 'run_svsim_tests' to show 10 SV tests
Run 'run_mvsim_tests' to show 10 MV tests

Single Vehicle Sim tests will also show plots for 5 of the scenarios and Multi-Vehicle will show all plots in a separate window.

AI Use Case Statement:

AI was used for much of the creation of the testing environment and the outputs from testing as the team was largely unfamiliar with using Matlab
to create a testing environment like this. Majority of the controller function was created manually but when errors arose and unexpected behavior occurred, 
AI was used to help debug and correct issues.
